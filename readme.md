## Gameplay/Idea
Players start off with one sqaure of territory in his or her 'country' and _x_ units of Power.  

* Territory:
	* Factories, farms, and military installations may be built on claimed territory squares
	* Other countries may claim unguarded territory squares
	* Territory squares may be guarded by military units
* Power:
	* Factories and farms add to a country's power
	* Claiming territory squares deducts from a country's power
* Military:
	* Military installations create and repair military units
	* Military units can move between territory units
	* Military units automatically claim unclaimed and unguarded territory units
